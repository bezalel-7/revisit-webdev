      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Linus Torvalds, a Finnish-American software engineer, holds a prominent
        position in the open-source software community. Born on December 28,
        1969, in Helsinki, Finland, Torvalds demonstrated an early interest in
        computers. During his time studying computer science at the University
        of Helsinki, he embarked on a personal project in 1991, which involved
        the development of a new operating system kernel. This endeavor
        eventually led to the creation of the Linux kernel, a groundbreaking
        achievement in the field of software development. Torvalds released the
        first version, known as Linux kernel 0.01, in September 1991, and he
        continued to enhance and refine it over the years.One of the core
        principles underlying Torvalds' work is open-source collaboration. To
        encourage the growth and involvement of a diverse community, he released
        the Linux kernel under the GNU General Public License (GPL), granting
        users the freedom to access, modify, and distribute the source code.
        This inclusive approach attracted a vast community of developers who
        have collectively contributed to the ongoing development and improvement
        of the Linux kernel.The impact and adoption of the Linux kernel have
        been remarkable. It serves as the foundation for numerous operating
        systems, including popular Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora,
        and Debian. Its versatility and stability have made it a favored choice
        for a wide range of devices, from servers and mainframes to embedded
        systems and consumer electronics.In addition to his work on the Linux
        kernel, Torvalds also created the Git version control system. Initially
        developed to manage the Linux kernel's source code, Git has evolved into
        the industry-standard version control system, widely adopted by
        developers worldwide for its efficiency and scalability. Overall, Linus
        Torvalds' contributions to the world of technology, particularly with
        the creation of the Linux kernel and the Git version control system,
        have significantly influenced the software development landscape,
        powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers and fostering a
        collaborative spirit within the open-source community.
